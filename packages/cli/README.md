## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies

- **[TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo)**: An incremental bundler and build system optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos. It handles the complexity of managing multiple packages and applications within a single repository.

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A powerful React framework that provides a robust foundation for building web applications with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances developer productivity through better tooling and error catching.

- **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)**: A modern database toolkit that provides a type-safe and intuitive way to interact with your database through generated queries.

- **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)**: A UI development environment for building, documenting, and testing components in isolation.

### Environment Management

- **[@t3-oss/env-core](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env)**: A library for managing type-safe environment variables across your entire monorepo.

- **[@t3-oss/env-nextjs](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env)**: Next.js-specific environment variable validation and typing, ensuring type safety for environment variables in your Next.js applications.

### Development Tools

- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: A pluggable linting utility that helps maintain code quality and consistency.

- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)**: An opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style across your project.

- **[cspell](https://cspell.org/)**: A spell checker for code that helps catch spelling errors in identifiers, strings, and comments.

## Environment Setup

### Development Services

The project uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to manage development services, including the database. The configuration is defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  cockroach:
    container_name: monorepo-starter-cockroach-dev
    image: cockroachdb/cockroach:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - '26258:26257'
      - '8082:8080'
    command: start-single-node --insecure
    volumes:
      - '${PWD}/cockroach-data/crdb:/cockroach/cockroach-data'
```

Managing services is simple with the provided scripts:

```bash
# Start the database and other services
yarn db:start

# Stop all services
yarn db:stop
```

Service access points:

- CockroachDB UI: http://localhost:8082
- Database port: 26258

You can extend the `docker-compose.yml` to include additional services needed for your development environment, such as Redis, Elasticsearch, or other databases.

### Environment Variables

The project uses [t3-env](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env) for type-safe environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Database connection URL
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Add other variables as needed
```

The type safety is enforced through schema definitions:

```typescript
// Schema definition example
import { createEnv } from '@t3-oss/env-core'

export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
  },
  runtimeEnv: process.env,
})
```

For Next.js applications, you can use [@t3-oss/env-nextjs](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env) which provides additional Next.js-specific validations:

```typescript
// apps/web/env.ts
import { createEnv } from '@t3-oss/env-nextjs'

export const env = createEnv({
  // ... configuration
})
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a new monorepo:

   ```bash
   npx monorepo-starter init
   ```

2. Navigate to project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-monorepo
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version >= 22
- Yarn version >= 1.22
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### Starting Development Environment

1. Start the database:

   ```bash
   yarn db:start
   ```

2. Start the development servers:

   ```bash
   # Start all apps
   yarn dev

   # Or start a specific app
   yarn dev --filter=web
   yarn dev --filter=workshop
   ```

3. Access services:
   - CockroachDB UI: http://localhost:8082
   - Database port: 26258

### Building Packages

Build all packages and applications:

```bash
yarn build
```

This command:

- Compiles TypeScript code
- Bundles assets
- Generates necessary files
- Respects dependencies between packages

### Type Checking

Run type checking across the entire monorepo:

```bash
yarn typecheck
```

### Linting

Lint all files in the monorepo:

```bash
yarn lint
```
